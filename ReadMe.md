# Bookworm (project from 2015-16)

## Introduction

> This project is in the process of a migration to Swift 4.

> This was a project I worked on both to top up my skills and to learn new ones. I was working with a startup that shut down recently. The aim was to set up a marketplace for used text books that separated buys and sellers by the university they attended. When you sign up, you must sign up with your .edu email address thereby ensuring that purchased books are the correct university version. I coded the entire program except for the barcode scanning which I integrated with my platform using code I found online. The developer is credited on the code file.


## Tools Used

> This project used a myriad of interesting tools. To find books, you could use the `barcode scanner` to scan the book and search over the `Google Books API`. The storing and retrieving was done using the `Google Firebase` framework. 

## Installation

> The code only works on older devices running iOS9 and below since it was written in Swift 2. If you choose to check it out, run `pod install` to install the necessary pods (assuming you already have CocoaPods installed). Then just hit the big play button on the XCode IDE and you should be in business (not for very long evidently).
>Please check out the working Swift 4 barcode scanner on my github. That one works well for all iOS and Swift versions as of Oct 2018.
